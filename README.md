This project uses fetch api to to get a set of random user data and displays that data on the page. When a user a clicked a card pops up showing more details about the user. You can click through the users detailed cards by using the previous or next buttons. The users can also be filtered by name.

I used JavaScript to dynamically change background colors, fonts, borders, and various styling on the page.
